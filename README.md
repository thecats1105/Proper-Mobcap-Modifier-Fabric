# Proper-Mobcap-Modifier
A simple mod to "properly" modify mobcaps

This mod just modifies SpawnGroup enum getters to get the values from config instead. 100% Without magic.

Works on both client and server, not required on client.


Configures for each spawn group:

- Mob cap
- Despawn start range (the 30s one) (aka 5 min)
- Immediate despawn range
- Is peaceful?
- Is rare? (20s spawn cycle)
